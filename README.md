My flavour of Models &amp; Controllers for Express.js.

#todo
* Fix / finish controller.updated method.
* ChildController Unit Test.

# Roadmap
* enable "object" as storage type
* enable nested objects storage
* Make all refernces to db go through 'self.db' so that when I copy methods I don't get that fucking error.
* ChildModel AcceptedParents filter
* ChildControllers
* Rename storedAttributes to Attributes
* Deal with that strange 3rd element in storedAttributes (originally intended for privacy)
* Re-Write Controllers to be more awesome
* SQL storage events? Write this as a seperate module?
